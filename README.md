# EmbeddedEngine

## Description

EmbeddedEngine is a Rust-based project focused on providing tools for analyzing decentralized ledgers and implementing cryptographic primitives. It aims to offer a robust and efficient platform for developers and researchers to explore blockchain data, build custom applications, and leverage secure cryptographic functions. The project prioritizes performance, security, and modularity, making it suitable for various use cases, from embedded systems to large-scale data analysis pipelines. By providing a comprehensive suite of tools, EmbeddedEngine seeks to lower the barrier to entry for working with decentralized technologies and facilitate innovation in the blockchain space.

## Features

*   **Ledger Analysis Tools:** Provides utilities for parsing and analyzing data from various decentralized ledgers (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum). This includes block explorers, transaction decoders, and data aggregation tools.
*   **Cryptographic Primitives:** Implements a collection of commonly used cryptographic algorithms and protocols, such as hashing functions (SHA-256, Keccak), digital signatures (ECDSA, Schnorr), and key exchange mechanisms (Diffie-Hellman). These primitives are optimized for performance and security.
*   **Data Visualization:** Offers tools for visualizing ledger data, enabling users to gain insights into transaction patterns, network activity, and other relevant metrics. This allows for easier comprehension of complex blockchain data.
*   **Customizable Data Pipelines:** Allows users to define and execute custom data processing pipelines for analyzing ledger data. This enables tailored analysis for specific research questions or application requirements.
*   **Modular Design:** The project is designed with a modular architecture, making it easy to extend and customize with new features and functionalities. This allows for flexibility and adaptability to evolving needs.

## Installation

To install EmbeddedEngine, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. If you don't have them already, you can download them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/EmbeddedEngine.git
    cd EmbeddedEngine
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    EmbeddedEngine uses several external crates. To install them, run the following command:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

    This command will download and compile all necessary dependencies.

3.  **Optional: Install specific features:**

    Certain features may require additional dependencies. For example, the visualization tools might require a specific graphics library. Refer to the documentation for each feature to determine its specific dependencies and install them accordingly. You may also use feature flags in `Cargo.toml` to specify which features to include in the build.

    Example: If a feature called "visualizations" requires the `plotters` crate, you can enable it in your `Cargo.toml` file:

    ```toml
    [features]
    visualizations = ["plotters"]

    [dependencies]
    plotters = { version = "0.3", optional = true }
    ```

    Then build using:

    ```bash
    cargo build --release --features visualizations
    ```

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use EmbeddedEngine's features:

**1. Hashing a string using SHA-256:**

```rust
use embedded_engine::crypto::sha256;

fn main() {
    let message = "Hello, world!";
    let hash = sha256::hash(message.as_bytes());

    println!("SHA-256 Hash: {:?}", hash);
}
```

**2. Parsing a Bitcoin block (example assuming a `blockchain` module exists):**

```rust
// Assuming you have a module for blockchain interaction.
use embedded_engine::blockchain::bitcoin::Block;
use std::fs;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Replace with the actual path to your block data file.
    let block_data = fs::read("path/to/bitcoin_block.dat")?;

    // Assuming Block::from_bytes attempts to parse the raw bytes.
    match Block::from_bytes(&block_data) {
        Ok(block) => {
            println!("Block Hash: {}", block.header.block_hash());
            println!("Number of Transactions: {}", block.transactions.len());
        }
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("Error parsing block: {}", e);
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**3. Generating an ECDSA keypair (example assuming a `crypto` module exists):**

```rust
use embedded_engine::crypto::ecdsa;

fn main() {
    let keypair = ecdsa::generate_keypair();
    let public_key = keypair.public_key;
    let private_key = keypair.private_key;

    println!("Public Key: {:?}", public_key);
    println!("Private Key: {:?}", private_key);

    // Example usage: Sign a message
    let message = "This is a test message";
    let signature = ecdsa::sign(message.as_bytes(), &private_key);

    println!("Signature: {:?}", signature);

    // Example usage: Verify the signature
    let is_valid = ecdsa::verify(message.as_bytes(), &signature, &public_key);
    println!("Signature is valid: {}", is_valid);
}
```

**Note:** These examples assume the existence of modules and functions within the `embedded_engine` crate. You will need to adapt them to your specific project structure and API. Please consult the project's documentation for detailed information on each module and function.
