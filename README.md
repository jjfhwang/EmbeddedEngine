# EmbeddedEngine

## Description

This repository provides a foundational framework for building embedded systems applications using Rust. It aims to abstract away low-level hardware details and provide a set of reusable components and utilities, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than intricate platform-specific configurations. The EmbeddedEngine is designed to be modular, efficient, and easily adaptable to a wide range of embedded targets. It serves as a starting point for creating complex embedded applications with increased reliability and maintainability through Rust's safety guarantees. It provides basic abstractions for peripheral access, task scheduling, and inter-process communication, forming the core of a robust embedded system.

## Features

*   **Peripheral Abstraction Layer (PAL):** Provides a hardware-agnostic interface for interacting with common peripherals such as GPIO, UART, SPI, and I2C. This allows for easy porting of code between different microcontroller platforms.
*   **Task Scheduling:** Implements a cooperative multitasking scheduler, enabling concurrent execution of multiple tasks within a single thread of execution. This improves system responsiveness and allows for efficient resource utilization.
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Offers a message-passing mechanism for communication between different tasks or modules within the system. This ensures data integrity and avoids race conditions.
*   **Memory Management:** Provides a safe and efficient memory management system tailored for embedded environments, minimizing memory fragmentation and maximizing memory utilization.
*   **Error Handling:** Leverages Rust's strong type system and error handling capabilities to provide robust error detection and recovery mechanisms, ensuring system stability and reliability.

## Installation

To use EmbeddedEngine in your project, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed. If you haven't already, you can download and install them from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

1.  **Create a new Rust project:**

    ```bash
    cargo new my_embedded_project
    cd my_embedded_project
    ```

2.  **Add EmbeddedEngine as a dependency:**

    Open your `Cargo.toml` file and add the following line to the `[dependencies]` section:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    embedded-engine = { git = "https://github.com/jjfhwang/EmbeddedEngine.git" } # Replace with actual repo URL
    ```

    Note:  If you have a specific branch or tag you wish to use, specify it like so:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    embedded-engine = { git = "https://github.com/jjfhwang/EmbeddedEngine.git", branch = "development" }
    ```

3.  **Configure your target:**

    Embedded systems often require a specific target architecture. Create a target specification file (e.g., `thumbv7em-none-eabi.json`) and configure your project to use it.  A basic target specification might look like this:

    ```json
    {
      "llvm-target": "thumbv7em-none-eabi",
      "data-layout": "e-m:e-p:32:32-i64:64-n32-S128",
      "arch": "arm",
      "target-endian": "little",
      "target-pointer-width": "32",
      "os": "none",
      "linker-flavor": "ld.lld",
      "linker": "rust-lld",
      "panic-strategy": "abort",
      "features": "+soft-float,+strict-align",
      "cpu": "cortex-m4",
      "vendor": "unknown"
    }
    ```

    Then, configure your project to use this target:

    ```bash
    rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabi # Or your chosen target
    ```

4.  **Build your project:**

    ```bash
    cargo build --target thumbv7em-none-eabi --release # Or your chosen target
    ```

    You may need to install `llvm-tools-preview` if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
    ```

5.  **Linker Configuration:**
    Often, embedded projects require a custom linker script.  Create a `memory.x` file (or similar) to define the memory layout of your target.  You will need to modify your `.cargo/config.toml` to point to this linker script.  For example:

    ```toml
    [target.thumbv7em-none-eabi] # Or your chosen target
    rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-Tmemory.x"]
    ```

## Usage

Here are some examples of how to use EmbeddedEngine in your embedded Rust project:

**1. Peripheral Access (GPIO):**

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use embedded_engine::pal::gpio::{Gpio, PinMode, PinState};
use panic_halt as _; // panic handler

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
    // Assuming you have a GPIO pin defined as pin 5 on port A. This requires a HAL abstraction, so it is just a placeholder
    let mut gpio = Gpio::new(5, PinMode::Output);

    loop {
        gpio.set_state(PinState::High);
        // Simulate a delay (replace with a proper delay function for your target)
        for _ in 0..100000 {
            core::hint::nop();
        }

        gpio.set_state(PinState::Low);
        // Simulate a delay
        for _ in 0..100000 {
            core::hint::nop();
        }
    }
}
```

**2. Task Scheduling:**

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use embedded_engine::scheduler::{Scheduler, Task};
use panic_halt as _; // panic handler

static mut SCHEDULER: Option<Scheduler> = None;

fn task1() {
    // Task 1 logic (e.g., blinking an LED)
    unsafe {
        // Modify some external hardware here safely
        // Example: Toggle a GPIO pin
        // Replace with actual hardware interaction code
        core::hint::nop();
    }
}

fn task2() {
    // Task 2 logic (e.g., reading sensor data)
    unsafe {
        // Read some external data safely
        // Example: Read from an ADC
        // Replace with actual hardware interaction code
        core::hint::nop();
    }
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
    // Initialize the scheduler
    let mut scheduler = Scheduler::new();

    // Add tasks to the scheduler
    scheduler.add_task(Task::new(task1));
    scheduler.add_task(Task::new(task2));

    unsafe {
        SCHEDULER = Some(scheduler);
    }

    loop {
        // Run the scheduler
        unsafe {
            if let Some(ref mut s) = SCHEDULER {
                s.run();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**3. Inter-Process Communication (IPC):**

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

use embedded_engine::ipc::{Channel, Message};
use panic_halt as _; // panic handler

static mut CHANNEL: Option<Channel<u32>> = None;

fn task1() {
    // Task 1 logic (e.g., sending data)
    unsafe {
        if let Some(ref mut channel) = CHANNEL {
            let message = Message::new(123);
            channel.send(message).unwrap();
        }
    }
}

fn task2() {
    // Task 2 logic (e.g., receiving data)
    unsafe {
        if let Some(ref mut channel) = CHANNEL {
            if let Some(message) = channel.receive() {
                let data = message.data();
                // Process the received data
                // Example: Print the data to a UART
                // Replace with actual processing code
                core::hint::nop();
            }
        }
    }
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> ! {
    // Initialize the channel
    let channel: Channel<u32> = Channel::new();

    unsafe {
        CHANNEL = Some(channel);
    }

    // Run tasks (replace with a proper task scheduler)
    loop {
        task1();
        task2();
    }
}
```

**Note:** These examples are simplified and require adaptation to your specific hardware platform and application requirements.  You will likely need to integrate with a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) appropriate for your microcontroller.  Additionally, the `panic_halt` crate is used for minimal panic handling; you may need a more sophisticated panic handler for production systems.
